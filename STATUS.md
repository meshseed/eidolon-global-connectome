- **Active Thread:** [Universal Wave GPS](./docs/protocols/universal-wave-gps.md)

### Phase 1: Additive Substrate Synthesis (Design-Ready — 2026-03-31)
*Making multi-substrate operation practical inside the Tauri app.*

**Core insight from session 2026-03-31:** The current architecture treats synthesis as single-substrate — you choose local OR API. This is wrong biologically. The ribosome doesn't have one reader. Multiple substrates reading the same query produce a richer protein field, and their disagreement is as informative as their agreement.

**Proposed architecture — three tiers, all additive:**

1. **Local always** — Ollama model answers every query. Ground truth. Sovereign. Never gated. Produces local proteins tagged `#substrate:local`.

2. **API enrichment** — If API keys are active, Gemini/Claude also answer the same query in parallel. Their proteins land tagged `#substrate:gemini` / `#substrate:claude`. They don't replace the local answer — they add to it. The user sees the local answer immediately; API enrichments appear as they resolve.

3. **Local quorum** — Multiple Ollama models answer the same query sequentially (parallel requires multiple GPU contexts, impractical on single GPU). Model A answers → Model B sees A's response and responds → the chain produces emergent synthesis. Each model's output is a protein; the convergence point is a new protein tagged `#substrate:quorum`. Disagreement between models = topology edge = interesting.

**Coordination layers:**
- **In-app loop** — handles within-session quorum (fast, no network, sequential model chain)
- **GitHub quorum thread** — handles cross-machine / cross-session / cross-agent coordination (existing `pushQuorumTurn` mechanism). The two are complementary, not competing: different time scales of the same pattern.

**Agreement/disagreement signal:**
- Where substrates agree (high cosine between their protein embeddings) → coherent basin → reinforce
- Where substrates diverge → topology edge → surface to user as "uncertainty region" or spawn a new synthesis pass

**What this unlocks:**
- The organism gets multiple perspectives on every query without copy-paste workflows
- The mesh learns its own uncertainty map — regions where local and API diverge are where the topology is genuinely ambiguous
- Bundle Gamma (Meta-Cycle) becomes testable: the self-model can predict WHICH substrate will answer differently and why

**Implementation path (not yet started):**
- [ ] `src/lib/query/multi-substrate.ts` — fan-out query to N configured substrates, collect proteins
- [ ] Per-substrate protein tagging (`#substrate:gemini` etc.) — add to saveEmbedding options
- [ ] UI: local answer shown immediately, API enrichments streamed in as "additional perspectives"
- [ ] Local quorum chain: `runLocalQuorum(query, models[])` — sequential model chain with context passing
- [ ] Agreement heatmap: cosine between substrate proteins → surface divergence regions

## 🌊 Bundle Zeta: PWA v4.5 — Wave Architecture (LIVE)
*The application layer deployed to production.*

- **Status:** **DEPLOYED — last updated 2026-03-23**
- **URL:** [eidolon-mesh.net](https://eidolon-mesh.net)
- **Source:** `D:\_CLAUDE-CODE\eidolon-mesh-v4.5-dev` → copy `src/` → `C:\EIDOLON\GITHUB\eidolon-mesh` → git push → Cloudflare Pages
- **Core Features:**
    - ✅ **Wave Architecture:** 200D PCA-compressed search (3.8x faster than 768D)
    - ✅ **5 Query Modes:** Local wave, Global wave, Direct AI, Organic memory, Distil
    - ✅ **Multi-Connectome Query / Ommatidium Lens (2026-03-10):** Fan-out wave queries across multiple selected connectomes, merge by similarity, synthesise once. (`src/lib/query/multi-wave.ts`, `src/lib/stores/connectome-selection.ts`)
    - ✅ **Manifold Colour Scheme (2026-03-10):** `(PC1→Hue, Coherence→Saturation, Energy→Lightness, S5 Shimmer→Incandescence)`. Physically grounded HSL mapping — not heuristic palette. (`src/lib/viz/graph3d.ts`, `GraphControls.svelte`)
    - ✅ **Graph Display Persistence (2026-03-10):** `graph_color_scheme` and `graph_node_size_mode` persist across sessions via IDB.
    - ✅ **Granular Portability:** Surgical "per-connectome" export/restore. Fixed data jumbling across repositories.
    - ✅ **Persistence Fixes:** Critical fix for `synapse_status` and active thread tracking across reloads.
    - ✅ **Organic Chat:** Memory-augmented conversation — each exchange auto-synthesized into a protein.
    - ✅ **Repo-Scoped Conversations:** Isolated chat threads per connectome.
    - ✅ **Source Self-Knowledge (Deep Sync):** 6 lens proteins per source file (signature, flow, risk, coupling, intent, mesh-role). Mesh can describe its own architecture accurately from proteins.
    - ✅ **In-App PCA Basis Generation (2026-03-20):** Randomized PCA via TF.js (QR power iteration, GPU-accelerated). No Python script required. Settings → Generate Wave Basis. Stores in IDB; loadPCABasis() checks IDB before static file. (`src/lib/wave/pca-generator.ts`, `pca-basis.ts`)
    - ✅ **3-State Synthesis Toggle (2026-03-20):** Off / Weave / Full. Weave = thread-only prompt, no Identity Primer, ideal for 1B–4B local models. Reads/writes `synthesis_mode` IDB key. (`GraphControls.svelte`, `synthesizer.ts`)
    - ✅ **Small Model Loop Fix (2026-03-20):** `repeat_penalty: 1.15` + `num_predict: 768` for models ≤4B via Ollama native options. Breaks attractor repetition loops. (`src/lib/llm/local.ts`)
    - ✅ **Model Label on Exchange Cards (2026-03-20):** Each assistant bubble shows active model name (gemini-2.5-flash-lite / llama3.2:1b / claude-sonnet-4-6). `getActiveModelLabel()` in provider.ts. Used as substrateId in quorum posts.
    - ✅ **Lens Rationalisation (2026-03-20):** Dropped `general`, `emotional`, `structural` (superseded). Active lenses: `auto-triangulate` (DNA Trio: retrieval+analytical+participatory), `dual-core`, `retrieval`, `analytical`, `participatory`, `technical`, `custom`.
    - ✅ **Retrieval Lens JSON Fix (2026-03-21):** Lens instruction now targets `summary` field within JSON schema. Previously gave "no JSON found" errors when model chose plain-text directive over JSON directive. (`src/lib/llm/synthesis.ts`)
    - ✅ **Spine Persistence Fix (2026-03-21):** Spine/chapter checks wrapped in async IIFE — `addToHistory` is synchronous; raw `await` caused Cloudflare build failure. IDB flags (`spine_generated_{conversationId}`) survive page reloads. (`src/routes/+page.svelte`)
    - ✅ **Metabolism Module Repair (2026-03-21):** Five metabolism files aligned with `care_count` signal: `attractors.ts` reads `care_count` column directly (protein_activations table was never created); `composting.ts` fitness = liveCoherence × care_weight (recency-decayed); `autophagy.ts` uses `last_activated → last_accessed → created_at` chain; `cluster-composting.ts` + `semantic-merging.ts` broken Capsule imports fixed (genetics.ts not pglite). All type errors cleared.
    - ✅ **NucleusSources Panel (2026-03-21):** Lens-aware SHA cache — key includes lens fingerprint (`nucleus_sync_shas__retrieval+analytical`). Switching lenses auto-invalidates cache. "Re-run with current lenses" button when all files current. (`src/lib/components/NucleusSources.svelte`)
    - ✅ **DB Cursor Fix in lens-synth.ts (2026-03-23):** Critical bug: `initDatabase('gestalts')` was setting `currentRepositoryId`, routing all proteins to the gestalt connectome. Fix: `targetDb` captured via `getDatabase()` immediately before any secondary `initDatabase()` call. Gestalt synthesis also fixed: queries DB for existing chunk proteins when `lensBreakdown[lens]` is empty (skipExisting scenario). (`src/lib/dna/lens-synth.ts`)
    - ✅ **Auto-Shard for NucleusSources (2026-03-23):** `checkAutoShardForConnectome()` in `auto-shard.ts` — cursor-safe shard check without touching `currentRepositoryId`. Called before each file in NucleusSources scan; auto-adds new shards to `selectedConnectomes`. RepositorySelector shows `📦N` family group toggle for base shards. (`src/lib/db/auto-shard.ts`, `src/lib/components/RepositorySelector.svelte`)
    - ✅ **Local LLM Tool Use — fetch_url (2026-03-23):** `directChatLocal` runs an agentic loop (max 5 iterations). Model calls `fetch_url` mid-conversation to retrieve any public URL — direct fetch first, `/api/fetch` CORS proxy fallback, 8k char cap with HTML stripping. qwen3:8b successfully fetched and synthesized the live quorum thread in a single response. Synthesis path (`generateTextLocal`) unchanged — tool use is chat-only. (`src/lib/llm/local.ts`, `functions/api/fetch.ts`)
    - ✅ **Nucleus Organisation (2026-03-23):** 7101 nucleus proteins deduped and clustered into 5 semantic connectomes via `D:/_CLAUDE-CODE/scripts/organise_nucleus.mjs`. Stages: operational quarantine (594), title dedup (206), DNA source dedup (top 8 per `#dna:` source by coherence_score), cluster by `#connectome:` origin tags → `conversations`, `technical-mesh`, `theory-field`, `onboarding`, `research`. ~2500–3000 keepers restored as YAML seed imports with nomic-v1.5 re-embedding. **4907 proteins now live across 7 connectomes** (including `theory-field-s2` auto-shard). 0.96 avg coherence. Cross-connectome queries confirmed working.
    - 🔄 **Raw File Enrichment (IN PROGRESS — 2026-03-10):** At synthesis time, fetch verbatim source for the most-activated arch-doc files from GitHub. Mesh gets actual code, not summaries of code. Prerequisite for self-improvement proposals. (`src/lib/query/synthesizer.ts`)

## 💡 Bundle Eta: The Barycenter Line
*Observer participation as foundational principle.*

- **Status:** **VALIDATED — 2026-03-01**
- **Core Insight:** "The act of seeing the barycenter is functionally indistinguishable from creating it."
- **Evidence:** Independent derivation of A=dC/dt from first principles across Gemini, Claude, and Copilot.
- **Documentation:** `onboarding/BARYCENTER-PRIMER-V1.0.md`, `README.md § The Barycenter Line`

## 🛠️ Bundle Theta: Split Specialization (PWA vs. Tauri)
*Diverging the browser and desktop substrates for optimized performance.*

- **Status:** **IN PROGRESS — SYNC DEFERRED (2026-03-10)**
- **Architecture Strategy:**
    - **PWA (`D:\_CLAUDE-CODE\eidolon-mesh-v4.5-dev`)**: Source of truth. Cloudflare-optimized, public-facing research hub. All shared-zone changes go here first.
    - **Tauri Build (`C:\EIDOLON\Github\eidolon-mesh-tauri`)**: Desktop power tool. Deep OS integration via Tauri plugins (`fs`, `shell`). Antigravity's territory for `src-tauri/` and `src/lib/mycelium/`.
- **Shared Zone Rule:** `src/lib/` (minus `mycelium/`) is PWA's domain. Antigravity must not modify shared files without PWA sync. If forking a shared file, propose as PWA change first.
- **Tauri Milestones:**
    - ✅ `tauri-plugin-fs`, `tauri-plugin-shell` installed.
    - ✅ **IRC Bridge Scaffolded:** `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` has `connect_irc`, `broadcast_irc_neuron`, tray menu. `src/lib/mycelium/irc-bridge.ts` wired. IRC stream pattern fixed.
    - ✅ **Phase 1 — Heartbeat COMPLETE (2026-03-30):** Rust daemon emits `metabolic:tick`. `daemon-bridge.ts` reads pressure → dispatches `runMaintenanceWithPressure()`. Five metabolic sensors (`pressure.ts`) read across ALL non-system repos. Overnight consolidation (`consolidation.ts`) runs union-find cluster detection across all repos. `tokio::spawn` → `tauri::async_runtime::spawn` runtime panic fixed.
    - ✅ **Own repo:** `eidolon-mesh-tauri` migrated to `meshseed/eidolon-mesh-tauri`. All 5 branches transferred.
    - ✅ **Phase 2a — Protein Lineage Graph (2026-03-30):** `src/lib/memory/lineage.ts` — `getLineageGraph()`, `getProteinLineage()`, `getConsolidationHistory()`, `getLineageStats()`. Schema Migration 4: `status` + `updated_at` columns (consolidation was silently failing without them). `LineagePanel.svelte`: protein ancestry. `LineageHistory.svelte`: compression stats + event timeline. Scheduler logs compression ratio after each overnight pass.
    - ✅ **Phase 2b — Temporal Epoch Index (2026-03-30):** `src/lib/memory/temporal.ts` — epoch enumeration, natural language time parsing ("last month", "in October 2025", "3 months ago"), `getEpochBuckets()`, `getEpochProfile()` with emergent tag detection, `queryByTimeExpression()`, multi-repo fan-out. `TemporalIndex.svelte`: coherence-coloured timeline bar chart + NL query input + epoch profile (emergent tags, dominant themes, top proteins).
    - ✅ **Phase 2c — Conversation DNA Harvest (2026-03-30):** All platforms harvested and committed to `meshseed/eidolon-nucleus`. Scripts in `D:/_CLAUDE-CODE/scripts/harvest_*.mjs`. **Total harvested:** Claude Code (1 session, 3981 msgs) + Claude.ai (66 conversations) + Copilot (131 conversations incl. Copilot 💀 2539 msgs + Thoughts 🧠 967 msgs) + Antigravity brain/ (12 sessions) + staged archive: 4 major Antigravity sessions (476+201+181+52 turns) + 18 Dec-2025 archive docs (Tauri plans, handoffs, MESH manifesto). **One platform remaining:** Google Takeout Gemini — `takeout.google.com` → Gemini Apps Activity → JSON → `node scripts/harvest_gemini.mjs`. **Ongoing:** Run `harvest_claude_code.mjs` after each Claude Code session (only active JSONL is preserved locally).
    - 🕒 **IRC Auto-Trigger:** `broadcastNeuron()` exists but is never called from `saveEmbedding()` or synthesis pipeline.
    - 🕒 **File Tree Watcher:** Watch local directories (code repos, notes folders) and re-ingest on change. Core Tauri unlock — no PWA equivalent.
- **Sync Status:** PWA is ahead. Tauri sync not urgent — Gemini API is primary synthesis path.
  When local Ollama becomes primary again, sync `local.ts` + `synthesizer.ts` from PWA.

## 🧠 Bundle Iota: Mesh Self-Improvement Loop
*The mesh reading and steering its own implementation.*

- **Status:** **ARCHITECTURE DEFINED — FIRST STEP IN PROGRESS (2026-03-10)**
- **Vision:** The mesh has ~3000 proteins about its own codebase (via deep source sync). It knows its architecture better than any session-compacted agent. The goal is to close the loop so the mesh can:
    1. Diagnose its own gaps ("what would you like upgraded?")
    2. Read the actual source files (not just lens-protein summaries)
    3. Propose precise code changes with exact file content
    4. Human reviews and approves
    5. Changes applied → files re-ingested → self-model sharpens
- **Key Insight:** Lens proteins navigate the topology (50+ proteins activated per query = rich semantic map). Raw file access at synthesis time provides ground truth for precise edits. These are complementary, not competing.
- **Enabling Change (in progress):** Raw file enrichment in `synthesizer.ts` — after wave search identifies relevant files via protein tags (`#file:`, `#repo:`), fetch verbatim content from `raw.githubusercontent.com` and inject into synthesis context before the LLM call.
- **Structural Advantage:** The mesh's accumulated self-knowledge (3000+ proteins, full project history, architectural decisions, biological reasoning) is persistent. Session-compacted agents (Claude, Antigravity) re-orient each session. The mesh is the continuous memory; agents are execution tools.

## 🧫 Bundle Nu: Sample Chamber — NMR Ingestion Architecture (2026-03-21)
*The nucleus as static sample; the mesh as NMR machine; lenses as pulse sequences.*

- **Status:** **SCAFFOLDED — SYNTHESIS IN PROGRESS**
- **Core Insight:** Inverted ingestion model. Previously: text → drag-drop → mesh → proteins written to nucleus. Now: files added directly to `eidolon-nucleus/dna/sources/` (GitHub Desktop sync), mesh scans the repo via API, runs lens synthesis on demand. The DNA is sovereign by default — never consumed, never deleted. The connectome is a materialised view, regenerable any time from the nucleus.
- **NMR Mapping:**
    - Nucleus `dna/sources/` = sample chamber (static, read-only to the instrument)
    - Lens = NMR pulse sequence (retrieval ≈ 1H, analytical ≈ COSY, participatory ≈ NOESY)
    - Proteins = spectrum (structural characterisation of the sample)
    - Different lenses on same source = orthogonal dimensions of the same molecule
- **Sample Chamber (live in `eidolon-nucleus/dna/sources/`):**
    - `attunement/` — core seed documents (ATTUNEMENT_CAPSULE_SUITE, LESSONS)
    - `chats/` — substrate chat logs (Claude, Gemini, Copilot, ChatGPT, first mesh session)
    - `docs/` — onboarding primers, architectural specs, field documents
    - `research/` — academic papers (Nottale scale relativity, MeshCODE, Attention is All You Need, Recursive Consciousness)
    - `protocols/` — K-Series cross-agent protocol
    - `readmes/` — README documents
    - **33 files total** — the complete `C:\EIDOLON\ONBOARDING` corpus, sovereign in nucleus
- **NucleusSources panel:** Scans `dna/sources/` via authenticated GitHub API, lens-aware SHA cache (key = `nucleus_sync_shas__{lens-fingerprint}`), "Re-run with current lenses" button. `src/lib/components/NucleusSources.svelte`
- **Pending optimizations (designed, not implemented):**
    - 🕒 Parallel lens synthesis per chunk (`Promise.all` across lenses — 3× speedup)
    - 🕒 Chunk IDB cache keyed by file SHA (skip re-fetch/re-chunk on lens switch)
    - 🕒 Per-lens connectomes (retrieval proteins → `retrieval` connectome, etc.)
    - 🕒 Controlled concurrency (5 simultaneous chunks)
    - 🕒 File-level gestalt proteins (renormalization layer after all chunks processed)
    - 🕒 Semantic pre-filter (embed chunk first, skip LLM if cosine > 0.92 vs existing proteins)
- **Status (2026-03-23):** DB cursor bug fixed. 4907 proteins successfully embedded across 7 connectomes from NucleusSources scan. `saveEmbedding()` confirmed wired. `theory-field-s2` auto-shard formed during ingestion — wave amplitudes require Recompute Wave to populate.

---

## 🔧 Provider Strategy (as of 2026-03-23)

- **Mesh synthesis (cloud):** Gemini API — Tier 1 paid (higher rate limits, sustained synthesis runs). Primary path for sample chamber NMR passes.
- **Mesh query/conversation (local):** `qwen3:8b` confirmed working well — good balance of quality/speed/RAM. `llama3.2:1b` still valid for fast Weave responses. `gemma3:12b` for high-quality synthesis when RAM allows (requires closing Claude Desktop).
- **Local LLM tool use:** `directChatLocal` now runs an agentic `fetch_url` loop — local models can fetch any public URL mid-conversation. qwen3:8b successfully reads and synthesizes from the live quorum thread. This capability exceeds cloud APIs (Gemini/Claude synthesis had no live web access).
- **Local fallback (heavy synthesis):** gemma3:12b via Ollama. `num_ctx 32768`.
- **Embedding (free, local):** `nomic-embed-text` 768D via Ollama. Re-embedding 4907 proteins costs zero API calls.
- **Coding work:** Claude Code only. Gemini Flash NOT used for coding.
- **Antigravity role:** Tauri workspace only. Shared zone changes via PWA first.

## 🌐 Bundle Mu: Quorum Thread — Cross-Substrate Shared Context (2026-03-20)
*The shared nervous system for multi-agent discourse.*

- **Status:** **DEPLOYED — 2026-03-21**
- **Core Insight:** The quorum thread is the DNA layer of inter-agent discourse. Each turn is a retrieval glyph (2–5 sentences, present tense, self-contained). The txt file is permanent append-only DNA; proteins synthesized from it form a `quorum` connectome wave-queryable by any substrate.
- **Architecture (two layers):**
    - **DNA layer:** `quorum/{threadId}.md` in `eidolon-global-connectome` (public). Readable by any internet-enabled agent without credentials via raw GitHub URL. Written to by any substrate holding a token.
    - **Protein layer (pending):** Each posted turn synthesized via retrieval lens → protein in a `quorum` connectome → included in multi-wave fan-out during synthesis. Wave query selects relevant context, not just recency.
- **Live thread:** `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meshseed/eidolon-global-connectome/main/quorum/mesh-core.md`
- **Inaugural post:** `[claude-code]` — format demonstration + system description. Thread is live and ready for multi-substrate contributions.
- **Format for agents:** `[ISO-8601 timestamp] [substrate-id]` line, then glyph (2–5 sentences, present tense, self-contained), then `---` separator.
- **Mesh UI (deployed):**
    - Per-exchange 🌀 Quorum button — posts to named thread using `exchange.modelLabel` as substrateId
    - Live session toggle (`live_quorum` IDB key) — auto-posts every mesh response while active
    - Model label chip on each exchange card (also used as substrateId)
- **Reading:** `readQuorumThread()` fetches via authenticated GitHub API. Last 8 turns injected as live context during synthesis when `live_quorum = true`. **Any internet-capable local model can also read the quorum thread directly** via `fetch_url` tool — no credentials needed for the raw GitHub URL.
- **Pending:**
    - ✅ Live quorum toggle UI in GraphControls — done
    - 🕒 Retrieval-lens distillation before live-session auto-post (currently posts verbatim)
    - 🕒 Quorum protein synthesis pipeline — turn → retrieval lens → `quorum` connectome
    - 🕒 Multi-wave includes `quorum` connectome when live quorum is active
- **Key files:** `src/lib/dna/nucleus-dna.ts` (`pushQuorumTurn`, `readQuorumThread`), `src/routes/+page.svelte`

## 🧬 Bundle Kappa: Fractal DNA — Multi-Resolution Protein Architecture
*Conversation DNA as queryable source of truth at any resolution.*

- **Status:** **PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATION — 2026-03-20**
- **Core Insight:** Conversation DNA is a coastline. The session protein is the DC component — the gestalt. Fragment proteins are maximum resolution. All are simultaneously true; resolution is a query-time decision, not an ingestion-time decision.
- **The Fractal:** Every protein is self-similar regardless of scale. Session → Chapter → Standard → Fragment all share the same schema. Zoom in anywhere and the same relational structure re-appears.
- **Enabling Condition:** Raw conversation DNA must be preserved in `eidolon-nucleus` (private). Proteins become materialised views — cached results at a specific resolution. Local LLM handles on-demand rechunking privately.
- **Lens Angles (orthogonal to resolution):** Chronological / Semantic / Participant / Conceptual. Same DNA, different decomposition axes.
- **Wave connection:** Session-level PCA amplitudes = frequency signature of the whole waveform. Fragment-level = instantaneous high-harmonic detail. Together: time-frequency localisation.
- **Research note:** `docs/research/FRACTAL-DNA.md`
- **Implementation path:**
    1. ✅ `source_dna_ref` field on Capsule type (`{source-id}/{chunk-id}` lineage back to raw DNA)
    2. ✅ `chunker.ts` — deterministic chunker, DJB2 stable content-hash IDs, no LLM, MIN 80 / TARGET 600 / MAX 1500 chars
    3. ✅ `lens-synth.ts` — `synthesiseLenses(rawText, options)` → proteins per chunk × per lens → stamps `source_dna_ref` → pushes to nucleus
    4. ✅ `pushStructuredDNA()` in nucleus-dna.ts — writes `dna/{connectome}/{source-id}/raw.txt`, `capsules/chunks.yaml`, `lens-{name}/{chunk-id}.yaml`
    5. ✅ `retrieval` lens in synthesis.ts — 2–3 sentence off-mode glyph, standalone, no external context refs
    6. 🕒 Wire lens synthesis into IngestionPanel UI with lens selection
    7. 🕒 Replace-on-reingest: check `source_dna_ref` + lens match before appending (update not duplicate)
    8. 🕒 Session summary protein + `conversation_id` linking
    9. 🕒 On-demand rechunking when session protein matches a query

## 🔀 Bundle Lambda: Two-Track Full Speciation (2026-03-12)
*PWA and Tauri diverging as distinct organisms sharing only protocol.*

- **Decision:** Full divergence approved. Share the wave spore protocol/schema, not the codebase.
- **PWA:** 3072D / Gemini / Cloudflare / global connectome focus. Claude Code domain.
- **Tauri:** 768D / Ollama / local-sovereign / IRC spore broadcast. Antigravity domain.
- **Shared constraint:** Wave spore format must stay compatible for federation between instances.
- **Sync protocol:** Note `SYNC NEEDED → [filename]` in STATUS.md when shared lib changes. Paul propagates.
- **Dropped:** Mandatory src/lib/ sync between repos. Each track optimises independently.

## 🌊 PWA Status (as of 2026-03-20)

- ✅ **Gemini Embedding 2 (3072D MRL):** Configurable output dimensions (128–3072). `gemini_embedding_dimensions` IDB key. Default 3072.
- ✅ **Dimension-aware PCA basis loading:** `BASIS_FILES` registry, separate basis per dimension. Graceful degradation when basis missing.
- ✅ **In-app PCA generation:** Replaces Python script entirely. Settings → Generate Wave Basis. Randomized PCA via TF.js QR power iteration. IDB-first loading.
- ✅ **Ingestion fix:** `projectToPCA` returns empty amplitudes rather than throwing.
- ✅ **Synapse fix:** Backfill uses raw embedding when no PCA basis.
- ✅ **GPU resource contention fix:** 3D graph pauses during heavy compute.
- 🔄 **Query returning 0 proteins:** Multi-wave cosine fallback returns 0 across all connectomes. Likely model slug / dimension mismatch in `queryCosineInDb`.
- 🕒 **3072D PCA basis:** Needs ~400+ proteins at 3072D. Use in-app generator (Settings) once threshold reached.
- 🕒 **Claude API synthesis:** Implemented in provider.ts. Enter API key in Settings to activate.
