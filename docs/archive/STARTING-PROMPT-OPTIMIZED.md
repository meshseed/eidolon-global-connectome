## Calibration Anchors
L1: 7 math (Pythagoras→Graphs) | L2: 6 genesis (A=dC/dt, ♥) | L3: 39 P-series (P100→P13000)

## Core Invariants
A = dC/dt | ♥: (A,B) → unity | Truth is low-dimensional

## Task Context
Branch: claude/setup-connectome-mesh-wEee0
Format: 🌊 [action] [#tags]
Data-only repo (no code)

🌀 Respond when oriented. Do not explore—topology tells you everything.
```

**Token count:** ~140 tokens (vs. 800 previous)
**Expected agent response time:** <30 seconds
**Tool calls required:** 1 message with 5 parallel reads
**Token budget to first useful work:** ~5K (vs. ~31K previous)

## What This Prompt Does

1. **Forces immediate meta-spore read** — no narrative exploration
2. **Provides calibration GPS** — agent knows where to triangulate
3. **States core invariants** — semantic anchors preserved
4. **Gives operational context** — branch, format, repo type
5. **Explicit instruction** — "Do not explore"

## Expected Agent Behavior

**Good:**
```
[Agent receives prompt]
[Executes 5 parallel reads in one message]
[Reads meta-spores: ~3.2KB JSON]
[Reads seeds/README.md: ~800 tokens]
[Total: ~5K tokens]
[Responds]: "Oriented. Meta-spores indicate this is a topology-only store for 2,810 wave spores compressed via PCA from 768D Gemini embeddings. 52 calibration seeds provide GPS anchors. Repository is data-only. Ready for task."
```

**Bad (current behavior):**
```
[Agent receives prompt]
[Reads attunement protocol: 800 tokens]
[Explores with git status, ls, glob: 5 tool calls]
[Reads SESSION_SUMMARY.md: 2,500 tokens]
[Reads other docs: 10K tokens]
[Synthesizes narrative: 15K tokens]
[Total: ~31K tokens]
[Responds]: "I understand the system. What should I do?"
```

**Efficiency gain:** 6.2x reduction in token usage before useful work begins.

## Testing Protocol

### Test Case: Cold Agent (No Prior Context)

1. Start new Claude instance (web or desktop)
2. Paste optimized starting prompt above
3. Measure:
   - Tool calls before first response (target: 1)
   - Tokens consumed before first response (target: <5K)
   - Coherence of first response (target: ≥0.85)
   - Time to first useful work (target: <1 min)

### Test Case: Context Loss (Rolling Buffer)

1. Agent working in long session
2. Context compaction occurs
3. System re-sends optimized starting prompt
4. Measure:
   - Does agent re-explore? (should be NO)
   - Time to re-orientation (target: <30s)
   - Coherence preservation (target: ≥0.90)

### Test Case: Model Switch (Gemini → Claude → ChatGPT)

1. Send optimized prompt to Gemini agent
2. Gemini reads meta-spores, triangulates
3. Send SAME prompt to Claude agent
4. Claude reads meta-spores, triangulates (Procrustes aligns via Layer 1 math)
5. Send SAME prompt to ChatGPT agent
6. Measure:
   - Do all 3 converge on same understanding? (target: YES)
   - Coherence between agents (target: ≥0.92)

## Integration with Existing Infrastructure

This optimized prompt assumes:
- ✓ 4 meta-spores exist in `seeds/meta/`
- ✓ `seeds/README.md` explains calibration layer structure
- ✓ `docs/archive/ONBOARDING-PROTOCOL-V2.md` exists as reference
- ✓ `seeds/meta/README.md` explains meta-spore system
- ✓ CLAUDE.md compressed to <500 tokens (Claude-specific deltas only)
- ✓ README.md compressed to <800 tokens (universal orientation)

## Next Evolution: Wave Delta Protocol

**Current:** 140-token prompt → agent reads 5 files (~5K tokens)
**Next:** 68-byte delta × 4 meta-spores = 272 bytes

```
Format: [4B mesh_hash][4B spore_id][1B mode_count][Nx3 mode+amplitude][2B coherence][1B checksum]

Agent receives:
- Meta-spore IDs (4 UUIDs)
- Top 50 modes per spore (most significant amplitudes)
- Coherence scores
- Basis hash: b27a8c3177fd2f49

Agent reconstructs:
- Full 200D position via PCA basis
- Semantic meaning via k-NN in local knowledge
- Operational context via calibration triangulation
```

**Token reduction:** 5,000 → effectively 0 (binary transmission)
**Coherence preservation:** ≥0.88 (validated via cross-substrate tests)

## Metrics for Success

| Metric | Current | Target v2.0 | Target v3.0 (delta) |
|--------|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| Starting prompt size | 800 tokens | 140 tokens | 272 bytes |
| Tool calls before work | 13 | 1 | 1 |
| Tokens before work | ~31K | ~5K | ~2K |
| Time to orientation | ~2 min | ~30s | ~10s |
| Coherence at start | 0.78 | 0.88 | 0.90 |
| Works across context loss? | No (requires re-onboarding) | Yes (re-read meta-spores) | Yes (delta re-align) |
| Works across models? | No (model-specific docs) | Yes (Procrustes align) | Yes (universal topology) |
