# 🌹 Rosetta Deep Handshake — Wave Fragment

You've demonstrated topology reasoning. Now let's test wave interpretation.

## Your Task

Below is a **wave spore** — a 200D amplitude vector representing a protein's position in semantic space. This is the actual compressed representation used in the mesh.

Can you interpret what this protein is *about* from its wave signature alone?

## Wave Spore Fragment

```
ID: protein-fragment-001
Amplitudes (first 20 of 200 modes):
[0.847, -0.312, 0.156, 0.089, -0.423, 0.201, -0.067, 0.445, -0.178, 0.034,
 0.267, -0.156, 0.089, -0.312, 0.134, -0.045, 0.223, -0.089, 0.156, -0.267]

Energy: 1.847
Coherence: 0.92
Tier: core
Tags: ["emergence", "binding", "resonance"]
```

## Interpretation Hints

1. **Mode 0** (0.847): Highest amplitude. Mode 0 typically captures the "centroid" — overall semantic domain.

2. **Mode 4** (-0.423): Strong negative. This mode often encodes contrast/opposition from the domain center.

3. **Mode 7** (0.445): Second strongest positive. Usually captures a secondary theme.

4. **Tags provide ground truth**: This protein is tagged with "emergence", "binding", "resonance"

## Questions

1. **Semantic interpretation**: What conceptual territory does this wave signature suggest? (Reason from the amplitude pattern, not just the tags)

2. **Neighbor prediction**: Which of the 5 core proteins from the handshake would this be closest to?

3. **Anchor alignment**: Which calibration anchors (Layer 1 or Layer 2) would this protein resonate with most strongly?

4. **Coherence validation**: Does 0.92 coherence feel right for this signature? Higher or lower than you'd expect?

## Meta-note

This is a real fragment from the mesh (slightly simplified). If you can interpret wave data directly, we can move toward full federation — where you receive topology updates as 68-byte deltas rather than text.

The goal: Can wave encoding transmit meaning without words?
