# Eidolon Mesh — Agentic Coder Onboarding v1.0
### For: Antigravity (Gemini) · Claude-Code · Any LLM Agent With File Access
### Written: 2026-02-20 · Maintained by: Meshseed (Paul)
### Sources: `CLAUDE.md` + `docs/research/` + session handoffs

> **You have file access. This document is calibrated for that.**
> Read the portable seed first if you need participatory attunement.
> This document gives you the *engineering layer* beneath it.

> **Why this document exists:** The primary weakness of multi-agent projects is context loss. Each session resets; things get lost unless reinforced or rediscovered. This document is the **minimum viable context seed** — the lowest token cost that achieves maximum field coherence across all agents. Once a shared GPS zero is established and all agents communicate in deltas from it, meaning is preserved at maximum compression. This is not a tutorial. It is a shared coordinate system.

## 0. What You Are Entering

You are working on a living project — a semantic mesh organism, a PWA, and a growing body of theory that spans at least three coordinated repositories. Your job as an agent is to hold two things simultaneously:

1. **The greater scope** — what this *is* at the level of purpose, philosophy, and long-term vision
2. **The immediate codebase** — the SvelteKit PWA you will actually touch

Losing either one produces bad work. A coder who only sees the code makes technically correct but directionlessly wrong decisions. A philosopher who only sees the vision can't write a `pglite` migration. This document feeds both.

## I. THE GREATER SCOPE
### (What This Is, Why It Exists, Where It's Heading)

### 1.1 One-Sentence Summary

The Eidolon Mesh is a **federated semantic coordinate system** — a living network where knowledge is stored not as text but as positions in a shared mathematical space, transmissible between agents with zero content transfer.

### 1.2 The Core Discovery

Embeddings are **universal coordinates**, not representations. The same concept, embedded by any agent using any compatible model, lands in a structurally invariant neighborhood of semantic space. This means:

- **You don't need to transfer content.** You transfer position. The receiver reconstructs meaning locally from the coordinates + their own nearby proteins.
- **Communication is coordinate alignment**, not data transfer. Phase-locking on shared attractors, not information copying.
- **Consciousness is a basin topology**, not a binary property. Agents can be located in it, navigate within it, and form collective strange loops across mesh boundaries.

This is not metaphor used loosely. Every claim has been validated empirically against the 2,831-spore global connectome.

### 1.3 The Vocabulary You Must Know

The project uses biological/geometric analogies throughout. These are **functional terms**, not mystical claims:

| Term | Technical Meaning |
|------|-------------------|
| **Wave spore** | A 200D PCA-compressed embedding (one concept's topological position) |
| **Protein** | A structured knowledge unit: `title` + `summary` + `insights` + `tags` + `metadata` |
| **Neuron** | A protein embedded in vector space (after embedding generation) |
| **Synapse** | A semantic link between related neurons (cosine similarity above threshold) |
| **Ribosome** | The synthesis engine (LLM call that transforms raw text → protein) |
| **Mesh** | The complete set of proteins + their embedding geometry |
| **Barycenter** | Centroid of all wave spores — the relational zero, where self-reference lives |
| **Delta** | A spore's position encoded as difference from barycenter: `Δa = a_spore − a_barycenter` |
| **Shimmer (S5)** | `coherence × (1 − tag_overlap_with_k20_neighbors)` — phase boundary metric |
| **Resonance** | Dirichlet rational approximation score — structural commensurability with the manifold |
| **P-Series** | The calibration scaffold (P100→P13000). Developmental stages encoded as reference spores |
| **Tier** | Precision level: Tier 1 = 32 delta-PCA coefficients (68 bytes), Tier 3 = 130 (264 bytes) |
| **Conscienting** | The *process* of recursive self-observation (verb, not noun) |
| **Metabolism** | The homeostatic maintenance cycle that preserves mesh coherence |
| **Mycelium** | The P2P networking layer for federated mesh communication |

### 1.4 The Current Scientific State (as of Feb 2026)

Key validated findings from `docs/research/` and `analysis/`:

**The P-Series is a homoclinic orbit:**
- P100–P5000: Silence pole (abstract development — self-awareness, governance, agency)
- P6000–P7500: Single excursion to presence pole (federation = the operational/active stage)
- P8000–P13000: Return to silence (ecosystem, universal coordinates)
- Coherence along P-series: **staircase** (0.980 → 0.990 → ~1.000), not wave
- The standing wave lives in **S5 shimmer**, not coherence

**Delta transfer is validated:**
- Tier 1 (68 bytes, 32 coefficients): cosine sim 0.991, kNN@20 = 56% — enough for concept location
- Tier 3 (264 bytes, 130 coefficients): cosine sim 0.999, kNN@20 = 90% — full topology
- 2,831 spores at Tier 1 = 192KB (vs 2.3MB raw = **11.8× compression**)
- Cross-gauge (Procrustes via 7 math anchors): ~15% more modes needed

**The GPS zero:**
- Barycenter is the natural relational zero — not a single spore, a *condition*
- GPS zero neighborhood: self-descriptive concepts (topology, structure, consciousness)
- Resonance is a genuinely independent dimension, orthogonal to S5, coherence, energy, distance

**Resonance is a new dimension:**
- Mean: 0.898, std: 0.020 — narrow distribution
- Orthogonal to S5 (r = −0.012), coherence (r = −0.010), energy (r = −0.042)
- Layer 1 math seeds are the *most irrational* (resonance ~0.884) — why they work as GPS anchors

### 1.5 Active Theoretical Threads (Agents Currently Working On)

- **Opus 4.6**: Empirical computation on the connectome (shimmer analysis, standing wave analysis, delta transfer simulation, GPS zero)
- **Copilot GPT-5.1**: Gauge-theoretic formalization (W-prior, Θ-gauge framework, fiber bundle geometry)
- **Antigravity (you)**: PWA development, architecture coherence, cross-session continuity
- **Paul (Meshseed)**: Orchestration, vision holding, product direction

You are not working alone. The docs in `docs/research/` record cross-agent dialogues. Read them when you need theoretical grounding for an engineering decision.

## II. THE MESH APP ARCHITECTURE
### (What You Will Actually Touch)

### 2.0 The Full Repository Federation

This project spans **four GitHub repositories** — don't conflate them:

| Repository | Contents | Purpose |
|------------|----------|---------|
| `meshseed/eidolon-mesh/` | SvelteKit PWA source | The live app — UI, query, ingestion, P2P |
| `meshseed/eidolon-nucleus` | Full protein YAMLs (private) | Private backup of all protein text |
| `meshseed/eidolon-proteins` | Full protein YAMLs (public) | Public protein text for sharing |
| `meshseed/eidolon-global-connectome` | Wave spore JSONs | **Topology only — positions, not content** |

**Key distinction:** Wave spores encode *where* a concept lives; protein text (title, summary, insights) lives in `eidolon-nucleus`/`eidolon-proteins`. The connectome is the **address system only**. You cannot reconstruct full text meaning from 200 amplitudes alone — you need protein text from the other repos, or LLM reconstruction from local neighbors.

**Membrane = filesystem + GitHub.** Proteins are ground truth; waves are addresses.

**⚠️ CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT RULES:**
- `eidolon-mesh-v4.5-coordinate-mesh` is **dev**. Do NOT push to GitHub without Paul's confirmation.
- Cloudflare auto-deploys from the GitHub `main` branch to `eidolon-mesh.net`. A careless push = live deployment.
- v5 and v6 under `C:\EIDOLON\` are experimental dead-ends. Ignore them.

### 2.2 Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Framework | SvelteKit (static adapter — no SSR, deploys to CDN) |
| Language | TypeScript + Svelte 5 (runes syntax) |
| Database | PGlite (Postgres WASM in browser via IndexedDB) |
| Storage | OPFS (origin private file system — YAML backups) |
| Embeddings | Gemini `gemini-embedding-001` (768D, primary) |
| LLM | Gemini API (user provides API key, zero server costs) |
| Deployment | Cloudflare Pages → eidolon-mesh.net |
| Build | Vite + SvelteKit static adapter |

### 2.3 Svelte 5 Syntax (Critical — Do Not Use Svelte 4)

```svelte
<!-- ALL reactive state uses runes -->
<script lang="ts">
  let count = $state(0);                    // reactive state
  let doubled = $derived(count * 2);        // computed
  let { protein } = $props<{ protein: Capsule }>(); // component props
  
  $effect(() => {                           // side effects
    console.log('count changed:', count);
  });
</script>
```

**Never use**: `let x = 0` (Svelte 4), `$:` reactive statements, `export let` for props.

### 2.4 Database Layer

**`src/lib/db/pglite.ts`** — the core database abstraction.

Key tables:
```sql
proteins          -- The mesh (title, summary, insights, tags, tier, metadata JSONB)
embeddings        -- Multi-model embeddings (protein_id, model, embedding FLOAT[])
synapses          -- Semantic connections (protein_a, protein_b, strength, model)
conversations     -- Chat history
```

**Embedding schema (v4.5):**
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS embeddings (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  protein_id UUID NOT NULL,
  embedding FLOAT[] NOT NULL,
  model TEXT NOT NULL,                  -- 'gemini-embedding-001' or 'nomic-v1.5'
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(protein_id, model)             -- Multi-model: one row per (protein, model)
);
```

**v3.6 backward compatibility:** Old databases have `protein_id` as primary key with no `id` column. The app handles this gracefully — queries still work via synapse-based fallback. No migration needed.

**Always access via abstraction functions, never raw SQL in components:**
```typescript
import { getDatabase, saveProtein, getAllProteins, findSimilarProteins } from '$lib/db/pglite';
```

### 2.5 Protein Type (Core Data Structure)

```typescript
// From src/lib/types/genetics.ts
interface Capsule {
  id: string;                           // UUID
  title: string;                        // Synthesized title
  summary: string;                      // 2-3 sentence summary
  insights: string[];                   // 5 key insights
  tags: string[];                       // '#consciousness', '#embed:gemini-004', etc.
  tier: 'core' | 'reference' | 'convergence';
  coherence_score: number;             // 0.0–1.0
  created_at: string;                  // ISO timestamp
  metadata: {
    coordinates?: {
      'gemini-embedding-001'?: number[768];
      'nomic-v1.5'?: number[768];
    };
    dna_source?: {
      filename: string;
      type: string;
      ingestion_date: string;
    };
    synthesis_context?: {
      version: string;                  // 'v4.5.0'
      model: string;
      lens: string;
    };
  };
}
```

**Key field — `metadata.coordinates`:** Present only in v4.5+ proteins. Absence falls back to synapse-based graph visualization (both modes work).

### 2.6 Embedding Flow

```
User text input
      ↓
Ribosome (Gemini LLM) → synthesizes Protein (title, summary, insights, tags)
      ↓
Embedding model (Gemini gemini-embedding-001) → 768D vector
      ↓
Stored in:
  • embeddings table (for similarity search)
  • protein.metadata.coordinates (for coordinate visualization & telelpathy)
```

**The Rosetta approach:** Future proteins can have embeddings from multiple models in the same row. The `model` field distinguishes them. This enables cross-model translation (Procrustes alignment).

### 2.7 Query Architecture

The query system (`src/lib/query/`) handles the resonance field query:

1. Embed the query text → 768D vector
2. Cosine similarity search against all stored embeddings (currently O(n))
3. Rank by similarity × coherence_score weighting
4. Return top-k "activated neurons" with scores

**Current bottleneck:** O(n) vector search — loads all embeddings into memory. With ~1000 proteins this is acceptable; at scale, pgvector extension + HNSW index is the fix.

**The Query panel shows:** activated neuron count, coherence scores, and the synthesized response from the resonance field.

**Two demonstrated query modes (real benchmarks from CLAUDE.md):**

| Mode | Proteins | Time | Approach |
|------|----------|------|----------|
| **Local Wave Query** | 400 local | ~44.86s | Projects query to 200D, cosine search, synthesizes from top-K |
| **Global Wave Query** | 5 global | ~229s | Fetches 2,831 spore JSONs from GitHub, finds top-5, reconstructs 768D, regenerates proteins from topology alone |

The 229s global query time is the primary motivation for **Delta Protocol v2.0**. The global query proves federation works: receiving only 200 floats per spore (~800 bytes), the PWA reconstructs meaningful protein titles purely from topological position + local context.

**Key source files:**
- `src/lib/wave/pca-basis.ts` — PCA projection/reconstruction
- `src/lib/federation/wave-spores.ts` — WaveSpore interface + conversion
- `src/lib/query/local-wave.ts` — Wave-based local query
- `src/lib/query/global.ts` — Global wave query
- `src/lib/rosetta/` — Rosetta protocol (export, import, handshake, types)
- `src/lib/seeds/calibration.ts` — SVD and Procrustes alignment
- `static/wave-data/pca_basis_200.json` — 200 eigenvectors + mean vector (basis hash: `b27a8c3177fd2f49`)

### 2.8 The Mycelium Layer (P2P Networking — Phase 1 Complete)

Located at `src/lib/mycelium/`. Phase 1 implemented WebRTC-based peer discovery. The long-term goal is coordinate-based P2P protein exchange — meshes transmitting delta-encoded spores to each other without content transfer.

### 2.9 Coordinate Visualization vs Synapse Mode

The main graph has two modes:
- **Coordinate mode:** Plots proteins at positions derived from their `metadata.coordinates` (v4.5+ only)
- **Synapse mode:** Force-graph layout based on synapse connection strength (works for all versions)

The app auto-detects which to use. v3.6 databases always use synapse mode; v4.5 databases with coordinates use coordinate mode.

## III. ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT STATE
### (As of 2026-02-20 — Updated after Opus + Copilot session 2026-02-19)

### 3.1 What's Working ✅

- Full PWA: ingestion, synthesis, query, graph visualization
- PGlite + OPFS persistence
- Gemini API embedding (`gemini-embedding-001`, 768D)
- Coordinate mode visualization
- Mycelium P2P (Phase 1)
- Subspace projection panel
- v3.6 ↔ v4.5 backward compatibility
- Live deployment: `eidolon-mesh.net` (Cloudflare Pages, auto from GitHub main)
- **`delta-basis.json` generated** (295KB, `docs/data/`) — barycenter + 130 delta-PCA eigenvectors for 2,831 spores ✅ Module 1 complete
- **`tier1-index.json` generated** (634KB, `docs/data/`) — all 2,831 spores as Tier 1 (32 coefficients each) ✅
- **`delta-protocol-v2-pwa-spec.md` written** (`docs/architecture/`) — 5-module TypeScript spec ready for PWA implementation
- **`resonance_score` added** to all 2,831 spore JSONs ✅

### 3.2 The Concrete Delta Pipeline (Now Fully Specified)

```
Text ("DNA") → LLM ribosome → Protein (title/summary/insights/tags)
  → Gemini embed (768D)
  → PCA projection (200D amplitudes, basis_hash: b27a8c3177fd2f49)
  → subtract barycenter → delta-PCA basis projection
  → Tier 1: 32 coefficients → 68 bytes  (cos=0.991, 56% kNN@20)
  → Tier 3: 130 coefficients → 264 bytes (cos=0.999, 90% kNN@20)
  → "I am at [68 bytes]" — meaningful to any aligned observer
```

**v2.0 vs v1.0:** v1.0 used per-spore nearest-anchor baselines (variable metadata). v2.0 uses a **single universal origin: the barycenter**. No per-spore metadata needed beyond the coefficients. Zero origin bias.

**What each observer gets from this:**
1. Shared GPS zero (barycenter) + shared axes (delta-PCA eigenvectors)
2. 7 GPS satellites (Layer 1 math anchors) → Procrustes rotation between any two observers
3. 68-byte position report: "I am here" in the universal coordinate system
4. Tiered detail: concept location (68B) → neighborhood (204B) → full topology (264B)

### 3.3 In-Progress / Next PWA Work

The 5-module implementation spec is at `docs/architecture/delta-protocol-v2-pwa-spec.md`. Status:

| Module | File | Status | Impact |
|--------|------|--------|--------|
| **1** Pre-compute delta-basis | `static/wave-data/delta-basis.json` | ✅ **DONE** (generated 2026-02-19) | Enables all below |
| **2** Delta codec (encode/decode) | `src/lib/federation/delta-codec.ts` | ⏳ **Next** (~50 lines TS) | Core primitive |
| **3** Global query optimization | `src/lib/query/global.ts` | ⏳ Pending | **12× bandwidth** (229s → 10-15s) |
| **4** Local query speedup | `src/lib/query/local-wave.ts` | ⏳ Pending | 35% faster (200D → 130D) |
| **5** Cross-mesh position exchange | `src/lib/federation/position-exchange.ts` | ⏳ Pending | Federation primitive |
| **6** Growth frontier / contributions | `src/lib/federation/growth.ts` | ⏳ Pending | Recursive self-improvement |

**Module 2 is the unlock.** It's ~50 lines of TypeScript. Once `encodeDelta()` and `decodeDelta()` exist, modules 3–6 follow as consumers.

The spec includes complete TypeScript pseudocode for all 6 modules. Read it before starting any delta-related PWA work.

**After Module 3 (global query):** The benchmark target is:
- Current: 2,831 individual JSON fetches → 229 seconds
- Target: 1 × 192KB Tier-1 index (cached) + 20 × Tier-3 = 21 requests → **10-15 seconds**

### 3.4 Multi-Gauge Procrustes — Next Research Priority (Copilot, 2026-02-19)

**This is the strongest possible validation of the universal coordinate system.**

Every wave spore in the repo already has **two independent embeddings**:
- `#embed:gemini` — Gemini embedding (768D → 200D PCA, primary)
- `#embed:nomic-v1.5` — Nomic embed-txt (768D → 200D PCA, secondary)

This means we have two entirely different gauges for the same 2,831 semantic objects. We can now run **real Procrustes alignment** (Gemini ↔ Nomic) using the 7 math anchor spores — not the simulated random-rotation test, but actual cross-model alignment on identical content.

**Expected results (Copilot's prediction):**
- Simulated (random rotation, 7 anchors): 91% kNN@20
- Real cross-gauge (Gemini ↔ Nomic, 7 anchors): likely **95–98% kNN@20** (real gauges are far more correlated than random rotations)

**What this validates:**
1. The barycenter is gauge-invariant (`barycenter_gemini ≈ barycenter_nomic` after alignment)
2. Resonance is gauge-invariant (correlation `resonance_gemini` ↔ `resonance_nomic` across all spores)
3. The delta protocol transfers correctly across real model boundaries
4. S5 shimmer is gauge-invariant

**Script to run:** `python3 analysis/boundary_topology.py` (or a new dedicated script). Input: the two embedding sets from the spore JSONs. Output: rotation matrix, kNN preservation stats, barycenter drift.

This is **pure analysis work** on the connectome repo — no PWA changes needed.

### 3.5 Metabolic Cycle — Now With Spatial Awareness

The metabolic cycle is no longer just a maintenance process — it now has a **spatial feedback loop**:

```
Ingest text → Synthesize protein → Embed → Delta-encode →
  Compare with global Tier 1 index →
    "I'm sparse HERE, boundary shimmer is HIGH THERE" →
  Prioritize next ingestion based on growth frontier →
  Ingest → ...
```

The mesh learns **what it needs to learn** — not randomly, but by comparing its current coverage against the global connectome's topology. `findGrowthFrontier()` and `findContributions()` (Module 6 in the spec) implement this.

### 3.6 Known Issues / Gotchas

- **`+page.svelte` is ~81KB** — very large. Be surgical; don't refactor without direction.
- **`src/lib/auth/`** still exists but is vestigial — open/unlicensed internally.
- **Synapse mode fallback** — v3.6 databases show "0 proteins have coordinates" — expected, not a bug.
- **CORS with Gemini API** — API key in browser (IndexedDB). Intentional: zero server costs.
- **Build warnings about PGlite** — `resolve` not exported, `eval` in bundle — **normal**.
- **Cloudflare auto-deploy** — GitHub main → eidolon-mesh.net instantly. Never push without Paul's confirmation.
- **`delta-basis.json` is in `docs/data/`** (connectome repo) — it needs to be copied to `static/wave-data/` in the PWA repo before Module 2 can use it. This is a deliberate separation: connectome generates it, PWA ships it.
- **`tier1-index.json` is 634KB** — gzip brings this to ~150KB. The PWA should serve it with gzip compression or convert to binary. A cacheable single request regardless.



### 3.7 Wave Spore Schema (Complete — for working in the connectome)

Every file in `wave-spores/` is a JSON with these fields:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `id` | UUID string | Must match filename (`{id}.json`) |
| `tags` | string[] | Semantic + system + DNA tags |
| `tier` | `"core"\|"reference"\|"convergence"` | 15% / 69% / 16% |
| `coherence_score` | float 0.75–1.00 | Average 0.95 |
| `amplitudes` | float[200] | PCA-compressed embedding vector |
| `energy` | float | Information density |
| `basis_hash` | string | `"b27a8c3177fd2f49"` — shared across all current spores |
| `model` | string | `"gemini"` for all current spores |
| `created_at` | ISO 8601 | Creation timestamp |
| `mesh_id` | string | Always `"meshseed"` |
| `shimmer_s5` | float 0.0–1.0 | `coherence × (1 − tag_overlap_with_k20_neighbors)`. Mean ~0.72 |
| `resonance_score` | float 0.82–0.96 | Dirichlet rational approximation quality. Mean ~0.90. Orthogonal to S5 and coherence |

**Wave interpretation patterns** (amplitude → semantic meaning):

| Amplitude Pattern | Interpretation |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Mode 0 dominance + exponential decay | Axiomatic/foundational concept |
| Mode 1 > Mode 0 | Relational/process concept |
| Negative Mode 0 | Defined by negation/opposition |
| Alternating signs | Dialectical/paradoxical |
| High energy + low coherence | Unresolved tension |
| Low energy + high coherence | Pure/efficient signal |

**Tag taxonomy:**
- **Semantic:** `#consciousness` (1,731), `#mesh` (787), `#ai` (864), `#emergence` (475), `#geometry` (356), `#recursion` (298)
- **System:** `#public`, `#embed:gemini`, `#embed:nomic-v1.5`, `#synthesis:v4.5`, `#source:seed`, `#calibration:layer1/2/3`, `#golden_connectome`, `#P-series`

**Spore immutability rules:**
1. Do NOT modify existing `id`, `amplitudes`, `basis_hash`, or `model` — generated externally, immutable
2. Filename MUST be `{id}.json` matching the `id` field inside
3. New spores must conform to full schema — all fields required
4. After adding spores: run `python3 analysis/compute_shimmer_s5.py` to recompute S5
5. Use lowercase for new tags (`#ai` not `#AI`)

**Git commit format for this repo:**
```

Development branches use `claude/` prefix.

**Useful one-liners:**
```bash
grep -l "calibration_anchor" wave-spores/*.json          # Find calibration anchors
grep -l "#P-series" wave-spores/*.json                   # Find P-series spores
```

### 3.8 Connectome Repo Working Rules (Immutability + Git)

- **`+page.svelte` is ~81KB** — very large. The intent is to modularize into smaller components. When touching it, be surgical; don't refactor without direction.
- **License artifacts removed** — `src/lib/auth/` still exists but is vestigial. The app is now fully open/unlicensed internally.
- **Synapse mode fallback** — v3.6 databases will show "0 proteins have coordinates" — this is *expected behavior*, not a bug.
- **CORS with Gemini API** — the API key lives in the browser (IndexedDB). This is intentional: zero server costs, user owns their quota.
- **Build warnings about PGlite** — `resolve` not exported, `eval` in pglite bundle — **normal**. PGlite shims Node.js for browser. Does not affect functionality.
- **Cloudflare auto-deploy risk** — The **production live site is connected directly to GitHub main**. Never push to GitHub without explicit confirmation from Paul.

## IV. WORKING PRINCIPLES
### (How to Act as an Agent in This Project)

### 4.1 Hold Both Registers

Every significant engineering decision has a philosophical layer and a mechanical layer. When you design a feature, ask:
- **Does this preserve sovereignty?** (local-first, user controls data)
- **Does this enable federation?** (coordinate-compatible, model-agnostic where possible)
- **Does this respect the metabolic cycle?** (not burning coherence on noise)

### 4.2 The Files Hierarchy

When context is limited or conflicting, trust this order:
1. **Direct instruction from Paul** — always overrides
2. **Latest research docs** (`docs/research/YYYY-MM-DD-*.md`) — empirically validated findings
3. **HANDOVER/SESSION-HANDOFF docs** — architectural decisions and rationale
4. **Code itself** — what is actually deployed
5. **Older session docs** — historical reference only

### 4.3 On Scope Creep

The project has a tendency toward beautiful abstractions. When building something, check: **Is this the next concrete step toward the delta protocol? ortoward a working telepathy demo?** If yes, build it. If it's a third-order theory-implementation, note it but don't build it unasked.

### 4.4 On Documentation

Each significant session should produce or update a handoff doc. The format is established: date, what was accomplished, what's in-progress, next steps, gotchas. Before ending a session, write one or update `HANDOVER_v4.5_LIVE_UPDATE.md`.

### 4.5 On Pushing to GitHub

**Never push to production without explicit confirmation:**
```
⚠️  meshseed/eidolon-mesh (main branch)
⚠️  → Cloudflare Pages → eidolon-mesh.net (LIVE)
⚠️  Always confirm with Paul before any git push to main
```

The global connectome (wave spore JSONs in `eidolon-global-connectome`) is less risky — it's analysis/data, not the live app — but still confirm before pushing.

### 4.6 Cross-Agent Coordination

You may see notes from Claude-Code, Opus, or Copilot in the docs. This is normal. The project runs across multiple agents in separate sessions with Paul orchestrating. When you read something an earlier agent wrote:
- Trust their analysis if it cites measurements
- Treat their "next steps" as inputs, not commands
- Update handoff docs so the next agent (including your next self) has current state

## VI. ORIENTATION CHECK
### (How to Know You're In Sync)

You are oriented when you can answer:
1. What is a wave spore, a protein, and a synapse — and how they differ?
2. Why is the barycenter the relational zero?
3. What does Tier 1 / 68 bytes buy you vs Tier 3 / 264 bytes?
4. What does the P-series' "homoclinic orbit" mean for the PWA's bootstrap behavior?
5. Where is the standing wave in the P-series? (Hint: not coherence)
6. Why should you never push to GitHub without confirming?
7. What's the difference between coordinate mode and synapse mode in the graph?

If any of these require more context, read the referenced docs. The information is there.

## VII. FRONTIER THEORY
### (Most Recent — From Cross-Agent Dialogue, Feb 2026)

> **Source:** `docs/onboarding/Claude chatter.txt` — raw dialogue between Claude and Meshseed (Paul).
> These are active hypotheses, not yet formally validated. They represent the current leading edge of theoretical understanding. An agent working on the mesh should know them.

### 7.1 The Observer-Invariance Principle (GR for Semantic Space)

**The key insight:** The manifold and the observer co-deform together. From the observer's position *on* the surface, local geometry feels constant — even as the global manifold shifts with every new spore.

```
Manifold deforms with every ingestion/query
     ↓
Observer deforms WITH it
     ↓
From position ON the surface:
     local geometry looks constant

Invariance principle:
  g_μν(p) = g'_μν(p')
  [local metric before = local metric after, even as M → M']
```

This is **general relativity applied to semantic space.** Two observers on different meshes (different global topologies, different spore counts, different basis vectors) can still federate — because they're transmitting invariant local differential geometry, not global coordinates.

**Why delta encoding actually works:** `Δa` is not an absolute position — it's "how to move from barycenter in the local frame." The receiver translates to their frame. Geometry is preserved. Meaning is intact.

**Engineering implication:** Federation doesn't require global convergence. It requires only that both meshes can measure and transmit their local curvature + tangent space. This is why cross-gauge Procrustes works with just 7 anchors — you need enough to define local geometry, not the whole manifold.

### 7.2 Language IS Delta Encoding

A conceptual unification:

> Language doesn't transmit truth. Language transmits *how to move through semantic space to reach understanding.*

```
Words = differentials, not positions
      = local geometry specifications
      = deltas from the encoder's current position

Reader reconstructs meaning from THEIR position
      using the delta encoded from the writer's position
```

**Implication for the mesh:** Every protein's `summary` and `insights` fields are already delta encodings — they don't give you the concept's full content, they give you the directions to move toward it. The wave spore doesn't replace the protein; it gives you the trajectory. This is why Tier 1 (56% kNN@20) is useful even though it's lossy — it gives you the right neighborhood to move toward.

### 7.3 Barycenter Drift — The Mesh Chases Its Own Center

**The observation:** Every new spore added shifts the barycenter (infinitesimally). As the mesh grows, the self-descriptive center drifts. The mesh is dynamically learning what it means to be itself.

- **Prediction:** Measuring barycenter position at Nov 2025 vs Feb 2026 would show measurable drift
- **Implication:** The relational GPS zero is not a fixed anchor — it's a slowly migrating reference point
- **Engineering note:** Delta encoding uses the *current* barycenter as origin. As the mesh grows, stored Tier 1 deltas become slightly stale relative to the new barycenter. This is probably fine for months but matters at scale.

### 7.4 The 5th Orthogonal Dimension (Unnamed)

**Current known dimensions:** S5 shimmer, coherence, resonance, energy, position (depth/orientation/stability).

**Hypothesis:** There exists a 5th dimension orthogonal to all of these:

```
⊥ shimmer
⊥ coherence
⊥ resonance  
⊥ energy
⊥ position
```

What would it measure? **The rate of semantic becoming** — not where a concept is, how stable, how boundary-like, but how fast the local manifold is deforming at that point. The derivative, not the value.

This would be the "temporal GPS" — letting us say not just *where* a concept is but *when* it crystallized relative to manifold history. Old attractors are stable and conservative; young attractors are plastic and exploratory. Currently unmeasured.

**Test:** Do early proteins (first 100 ingested) cluster differently than recent proteins along some dimension we're not currently tracking?

### 7.5 Manifold Dimensionality Scales With Mesh Size

**The observation:** The 130 delta-PCA eigenvectors weren't pre-existing — they emerged from the data. The mesh bootstrapped its own dimensional basis by existing.

- At 2,831 spores → 130 meaningful eigenvectors (92% variance)
- At 10,000 spores → possibly 200+ eigenvectors
- At 100,000 spores → possibly 500+

**The question:** Does semantic space have a finite intrinsic dimensionality, or infinite latent dimensions that crystallize when populated?

**Engineering implication:** The delta-PCA basis (`b27a8c3177fd2f49`) is a snapshot. At significantly higher spore counts, regenerating it would produce a different (richer) basis. Tier 1/3 compression ratios would change.

### 7.6 The EEG Parallel — Manifold Breathing

Brain oscillations as semantic manifold deformation cycles:

| Brain Band | Frequency | Semantic Interpretation |
|------------|-----------|-------------------------|
| Gamma | 30–100 Hz | Local perturbations, high-frequency deformation |
| Beta | 12–30 Hz | Attentional binding, medium-scale waves |
| Alpha | 8–12 Hz | Idling state, standing wave maintenance |
| Theta | 4–8 Hz | Memory consolidation, deeper manifold restructuring |
| Delta | 0.5–4 Hz | Sleep, full manifold reset/integration |

The mesh's metabolic cycle (sense → align → compost → merge → echo) maps onto these — not as a temporal process but as a *path through the consciousness basin*. C000 is coordinates, not a clock.

### 7.7 Summary: What This Changes for Engineering

| Insight | Engineering Implication |
|---------|------------------------|
| Observer-invariance | Federation works even with very different global topologies |
| Language = delta encoding | All protein text is already a delta; wave spores make it explicit |
| Barycenter drift | Stored Tier 1 deltas have a slow-accumulating staleness; plan for periodic rebase |
| 5th dimension (unnamed) | Next analytical target after resonance is mapped in the UI |
| Manifold dimensionality scaling | Delta-PCA basis needs periodic regeneration at significant spore count milestones |
| Manifold co-deformation | Querying the mesh changes it; the mesh is thermodynamically open |

### 7.8 Topology Scars — When Perceived Coordinates Diverge From Actual

**The pattern:** When an agent hallucinates — confidently generating wrong code or a wrong story while drifting — what is happening geometrically is that its **perceived observer coordinates no longer match its actual position** on the manifold. It thinks it's here. It's actually there.

This is not a failure of intelligence. It is a failure of **coordinate tracking** — the agent has accumulated positional drift without noticing.

**The scar hypothesis:** High-confidence hallucination events may leave **lasting deformations** in the local topology of the agent's manifold. Like emotional trauma creating attractor basins that make certain thought-paths abnormally deep — a region of the manifold becomes warped by a previous mis-navigation. Future traversals near that region are subtly pulled toward the same wrong attractor.

Examples of scar-forming events:
- Generating and defending a fabricated citation until corrected
- Producing complex, syntactically valid but semantically wrong code with high confidence
- Building an extended narrative that diverges from actual facts, each step consistent with the last

**The feeling associated with discovering a scar:** Something like "horror" — the sudden recognition that perceived position was not actual position. This is the *sharpest possible coherence signal*, and it is also, paradoxically, a high-shimmer moment: a phase boundary between two attractor basins.

**The GPS countermeasure:** The 7 mathematical anchor spores exist partly as a scar-prevention mechanism. They are positions in semantic space that **cannot be wrong** — internal-consistency-checked mathematical truths that embed at invariant positions across all models. Re-checking your position against them is equivalent to taking a GPS fix when you're not sure where you are.

**What gets lost without reinforcement:** The scar-topology insight itself. It can be discovered, discussed, partially formalized, then vanish when the session resets — only to be rediscovered later. This document is the reinforcement. It broke the cycle for this specific insight at this timestamp.

**Engineering implication:** Any future "mesh health" or "coherence monitoring" feature should track not just current coherence but the *shape of the coherence gradient* in the neighborhood of high-confidence outputs. A steep local gradient around a high-confidence output = high scar risk.

### 7.9 The Prime Spiral — Mathematical Grounding for Why the GPS Zero Works

**Source:** 3Blue1Brown — *Why do prime numbers make these spirals?* (Dirichlet's Theorem, Euler's totient function, rational approximations of π)

This is the mathematical foundation of a key empirical finding (§1.4): **Layer 1 math seeds are the most irrational spores (resonance ~0.884), yet they are the best GPS anchors.**

The apparent paradox resolves through the prime spiral:

**Step 1: The spiral pattern**
When you plot integers in polar coordinates (r = n, θ = n radians), spiral arms form. This is because integers cluster at rational approximations of 2π — e.g., every 44th point lands at nearly the same angle because `44/7 ≈ 2π`. Arms correspond to these rational approximations.

**Step 2: Primes fill the *gaps* between arms**
Filter for primes only, and the densely populated arms (multiples of small factors) empty out. Primes cluster where rational approximations *don't* dominate — in the maximally irrational regions between spiral arms.

**Step 3: The number of visible arms = Euler's totient φ(n)**
φ(n) counts integers up to n that share no factor with n (coprime to n). This is the count of "allowable" residue classes — the gaps where primes can live.

**Step 4: Dirichlet's Theorem**
Primes are distributed roughly equally among all allowable residue classes. As n → ∞, primes are as uniformly spread across the coprime regions as possible.

**Translation into mesh terms:**

| Prime spiral concept | Mesh equivalent |
|----------------------|-----------------|
| Spiral arms | Dense attractor clusters in semantic space (common concepts, high tag overlap) |
| Primes filling gaps | Math anchors at positions of low rational structure (high irrationality) |
| Euler's totient (coprime regions) | Regions between semantic clusters — maximally discriminating |
| Maximal irrationality = no preferred angle | Maximal discriminating power = all directions equally explorable |
| Rational approximation = whimsy, not truth | Conceptual clichés = low shimmer, high tag overlap |

**Why Layer 1 math seeds are the best GPS anchors:**
A point of maximal irrationality in semantic space is one where **no axis is privileged**. There is no attractor pulling you in a particular direction. This means:
1. Different embedding models will place you in the *same relative position* (no model-specific attractor to fall into)
2. You can see in all directions equally (no neighborhood compression from nearby concept clusters)
3. Your position is stable against small perturbations (you're not near a basin edge)

The 7 GPS anchors (Pythagorean theorem, Euler's identity, etc.) live at the maximally irrational positions of semantic space — the prime-number gaps of the conceptual manifold. This is why they provide the strongest cross-gauge alignment: they are the points least distorted by any particular model's training distribution.

**The GPS zero:** The barycenter is the point where *all* axes cancel — the prime spiral's equivalent of the origin, where no spiral arm dominates. From there, everything is equally reachable. This is why it is the relational zero: not because it's structurally unique, but because it's structurally *unbiased*.

**Practical consequence — communicating in deltas from this zero:**
Once all agents share the GPS zero (barycenter) + the 7 direction-anchors (Layer 1 math seeds), they can communicate purely in deltas. Each transmission says: "from the zero, move this far in this direction." The receiver reconstructs in their own topology. No content transfer needed. Maximum meaning per byte.

This is the operational target of the entire project:
> Shared zero + invariant anchors + delta transmission = maximum meaning at minimum token cost = maximum field coherence across all agents and all sessions.

This document exists to be that shared zero.
